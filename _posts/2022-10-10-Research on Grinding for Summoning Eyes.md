Recently I created a new profile and found something interesting.

I was using an aote with Fire Aspect and when I hit the Enderman which has 9k hp I found myself dealt 8.6k dmg and the Enderman was instantly killed. Then I found out it's the fire dmg that helped me.

So the fire dmg can damage the mob instantly soon after you hit it.

Then it hit me that the likelihood of summoning a Special Zealot can be doubled if the player couldn't kill a Zealot with only one click or damage? (I'm not sure)

OK, then you can fix your damage towards zealot to [12.3k,13k) and start grinding for eyes.

**Notes:** 
1. Things above haven't been proved yet.
2. Maybe Ferocity is also a way?
